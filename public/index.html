    <p class = "tab1"> Do you dare to play the famous brain teaser game?
      Here is how the IdiotTest works:
    </p>
    <p class = "tab2">
      Once you click "Start the Quiz button" the timer will start and your
      questions will appear. This is a multiple choice quiz and there'll be
      4 answer choices to every question. There is an answer to every question.
      The timer is called a Money Meter where you shall
      begin with a certain amount of money at the beginning of the question
      and that money will decrement a certain amount each second you do not
      answer the question. Once you reach to the Bonus question, if you answer
      it correctly you'll get $500 added to your score.
    </p>
    <p class = "tab3">
      Note: the amount of money you start out with and the amount of money
      decreased each second will depend on the question (difficulty). Read the question and
      also look at the images carefully as they may contain hints to answer
      question.
    </p>
    <p class = "tab4">
      If you click an answer before your Money Meter ran out, there are two
      possibilies. 1) If you got the correct answer, the money left on
      your meter meter is yours for that question. 2) If you didn't get
      the correct answer, you will have a score of $0 for that question.
      If you let your Money Meter run out and you haven't answered the question,
      you'll also get $0 for that question. When you've reached the Bonus question,
      if you answer the question wrong, you do not get an addiitonal $500 added to
      your money meter. However all the money you earned in the last 5 questions will be
      yours so all is not lost.
    </p>
    <p class = "tab5">
      The goal is to try to answer the questions quickly to maximize the money
      you earn but avoid looking like an IDIOT.
